This is the 'Etch-a-Sketch' project from TheOdinProject curriculum, in which you are supposed to create a sketchpad, in order to practice DOM Manipulation and Event Handling, while also being the first project to combine HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This was a really enjoyable project which emphasized on DOM Manipulation and kind of gave us a taste of the amazing things that can be done with it.
